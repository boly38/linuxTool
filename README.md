# linuxTools

## Introductions
Goal of this repository is to capitalize small samples, easy to understand, and easy to use, in order to learn and use linux.

2 rules:
- A sample is autonomous, and must not rely on another sample, or too much complicated external dependencies. 
- A sample must provide a readme with an HowTo.

## Subjects
- [Threads limit](./threads/ThreadLimits.md) - how to diagnose and test (java) linux thread limits

### Integrations

- [Discord](./integration/discord/Discord.md) - how to send small notification using curl+webhook
